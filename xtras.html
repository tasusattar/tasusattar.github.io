    <p>Hi! I'm Tasawar Sattar. People call me Tasu.</p>
    <p>
        This is a simple website that just has all my relevant stuff - in case you want to hire me (please!) or just get to know me.
    </p>
    <p>
        Go check out my <a href="index.html">ART</a> website if you want to see some cool stuff, I guess. That's just a bunch of my personal visual art pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's my website, so I'd also like to shamelessly plug the mobile video game I made.<br>
        It's called <a href="https://www.kochigamerz.win/BUMPiT">BUMPiT</a>.<br>
        I made it under the gamertag of <a href="https://www.kochigamerz.win/">KochiGamerZ</a> for my nephew.    
    </p> 
    <p>
        Cool thing is that I came up with the game concept myself and made it from scratch using Unity. I made these all these website myself as well, with simple HTML CSS & JavaScript. 
    </p>

    <p></p>
    <p>Here are some of the other things I've done:</p>
    <p><ul>
        <li><a href="onlineresume.pdf">Resume</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/tasusattar">Github</a></li>
        <li><a href="/freelance.html">Freelance Gigs</a></li>
    </ul></p>

    <p>And here are some AWESOME things on the internet. Enjoy! :D</p>

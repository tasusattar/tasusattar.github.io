    <p>Hi! I'm Tasawar Sattar. People call me Tasu.</p>
    <p>
        This is a simple website that has all my relevant info - in case you want to hire me (please!) or just get to know me.
    </p>
    <p>
        Go check out my <a href="index.html" target=”_blank”>ART</a> website if you want to see some cool stuff. It's a bunch of my personal visual art pieces like collages.
    </p>
    <p>
        As it's my website, I'm gonna plug the mobile video game I made.<br>
        It's called <a href="https://www.kochigamerz.win/BUMPiT" target=”_blank”>BUMPiT</a>.<br>
        I made it under the gamertag of <a href="https://www.kochigamerz.win/" target=”_blank”>KochiGamerZ</a> for my nephew (it means "little gamerz").    
    </p> 
    <p>
        The nifty thing is that I came up with the game concept myself and made it from scratch using Unity. I made all these websites myself as well, with simple HTML, CSS & JavaScript. 
    </p>

    <p></p> <p></p>

    <p>
        At the moment I work at <a href="https://www.dhakatribune.com/" target=”_blank”>Dhaka Tribune</a>, an English daily newspaper in Bangladesh. I work primarily as a sub-editor and <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14yeqDOzur9ixr0hPzKEnxsCmHxnbimjH?usp=sharing" target="_blank">page designer</a>. <br>
        I also initiated the revamp of their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dhakatribune/" target=”_blank”>Instagram</a> strategy - setting the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CuR3b3qPXby/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D&fbclid=IwAR1Ygmgpzf5MMKtaz08aWJaOtCqSy3AHD_FWd9KwIXS4V1GO8-z3KXZDreg" target="_blank">new carousel template for posts</a>; 
        establishing a morning and evening brief - and I continue to support the social media team with copywriting. <br>
        I even designed an <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/SYVdD6v7E1ZfH752akJFd0/DT-APP?type=design&node-id=1-2&t=xCjyadNnlJzP0yd1-1&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2&mode=design" target="_blank">app prototype</a> on Figma for them, but unfortunately they didn't have the funds to pursue the project further.
    </p>

    <p>Here are some of the other things I've done:</p>
    <p><ul>
        <li><a href="onlineresume.pdf" target=”_blank”>Resume</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/tasusattar" target=”_blank”>Github</a></li>
        <li><a href="freelance.html">Freelance Gigs</a></li>
    </ul></p>

    <p>And here are some AWESOME things on the internet. Enjoy! :D</p>
    <p><ul>
        <li><a href="https://libgen.is/" target=”_blank”>LibGen</a>: Free ebooks!  (use with calibre if you have an e-reader like a Kindle)</li>
        <li><a href="https://yts.mx/" target=”_blank”>YTS</a>: Movie Torrents (Careful with this one)</li>
        <li><a href="http://openemu.org/" target=”_blank”>OpenEMU</a>: Emulator Games</li>
        <li><a href="https://filecr.com/en/?id=95636024064" target=”_blank”>FileCR</a>: Software rips (Again, careful)</li>
        <li><a href="https://downloads.khinsider.com/search?search=space" target=”_blank”>KHInsider</a>: Video game music (found this gem when making the game)</li>

    </ul></p>

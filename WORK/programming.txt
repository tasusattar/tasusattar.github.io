An ardent fan of Python - it's versatility and accessibility are just uncomparable -
but also an approving supporter of anything JavaScript and Java. Having taken Python and Java courses
in University and taught courses to children, I have a strong sense of programming fundamentals, but
I've always enjoyed coding as a creative outlet.

An ardent fan of Python - it's versatility and accessibility beat all others -
 but also an approving supporter of anything JavaScript. Having taken Python and Java courses
 in university and taught courses to children, I have a strong sense of programming fundamentals. But
 I've always enjoyed coding as a creative outlet.

An ardent fan of Python (it's versatility and accessibility are the best)
 and also an approving supporter of anything JavaScript. Having taken Python and Java courses
 in university and taught courses to children, I have a strong sense of programming fundamentals.
 But I've mostly always enjoyed coding as a creative outlet.
